About:

VlaFoo is a 1-dimensional Vlasov solver (1 spatial and 1 velocity
dimension).  The spatial evolution is handled via a semi-Lagrangian
approach, and the velocity evolution is handled via a FFT and an
explicit Runge-Kutta method (either Euler or RK2 currently, with the
latter using dynamic time-stepping).


Compilation:

The command-line aguments are handled by the Boost program_options
library.  If this is not installed on your sysem, you can download the 
libraries from boost.org and compile just the program_options by calling
  ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=program_options

Other than that, just run make to produce the vlafoo binary.


Test cases:

Landau:
kx=0.2
eps=0.05


./vlafoo --nx 64 --nv 64 --tmax 100 --dt 0.00001 --tsave2 1 --tsave1 0.01 --kx 0.2 --eps 5e-3 --itmax=100000000 --ic=landau

doublestream:
kx=0.2
eps=0.05
v0=3

./vlafoo --nx 64 --nv 64 --tmax 100 --dt 0.00001 --tsave2 1 --tsave1 0.01 --kx 0.2 --eps 5e-3 --itmax=100000000 --ic=doublestream --vmax 16


Output:

File with name *vt are tab-separated values with time in the first
column.  They can be viewed using asymptote using vt.asy.

Files named plot* are 2D outputs snapshots of the velocity
distribution in space.  They are stored in the XDR format, with the
first two values giving the spatial and velocity dimensions.  Plot
files are viewed using either plot.asy (for individual snapshots) or
with anim.asy to produce animations.
